# A.N.D.R.O.I.D. Ops:
ANDROID Ops is a modified DevOps approach that focuses on S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relatable, and Timely) A.N.D.R.O.I.D. (Automate, Network, Design, Research, Optimize, Integrate, Deliver) Operations as 7 phases of project development. Each ANDROID is specialized to one specific purpose and should iterate even faster than a Lean Agile approach. The "Ops" portion focuses heavily on collaboration, communication, creative thinking, and deep cyber security practices.
<br><br>
Staff members choose their own ANDROIDs to ultimately help the organization reach Super Nova events. Their ANDROIDs should latch onto STARs and assist in steering, guiding, and manipulating stars to their final destination for cosmic-shifting results.
<br><br>
Each ANDROID needs to be titled with one of the below 5 phases.  The title must be short, concise, and easy to understand.
<br><br>
Below define the 5 possible phases when building ANDROIDs:

## AUTOMATE:
Step 1: Identify tasks within business processes that are candidates for automationStep 2: Choose appropriate automation tools and technologies for these tasksStep 3: Design and develop automated workflows to replace manual task executionStep 4: Conduct thorough testing of automated processes to ensure reliability and efficiencyStep 5: Deploy monitoring systems to track the performance of automated tasks and make adjustments as needed

## NETWORK:
Step 1: Evaluate existing network infrastructure for current capabilities and future needsStep 2: Plan a network design that enables enhanced connectivity, collaboration, and data sharingStep 3: Implement new networking solutions that provide secure, real-time communication channels across organizational boundariesStep 4: Set up governance for data exchange, ensuring robust security measures are in place within the network architectureStep 5: Continuously monitor network performance, optimizing it to adapt to new challenges and opportunities

Step 1: Identify tasks within 

## DESIGN:
Step 1: Define the project goals and objectivesStep 2: Identify the target audience and their needsStep 3: Develop the content and structure of the training programStep 4: Create the visual design and user interfaceStep 5: Test and refine the design

## RESEARCH:
Step 1: Conduct a needs analysis to identify knowledge gaps and training needsStep 2: Research best practices and industry standardsStep 3: Gather and analyze data to inform the design processStep 4: Develop learning objectives and assessment criteriaStep 5: Evaluate the effectiveness of the training program

## OPTIMIZE:
Step 1: Review and refine the training program based on feedback and evaluationStep 2: Update content and design to reflect changes in industry standardsStep 3: Incorporate new technologies and instructional methodsStep 4: Test and refine the updated programStep 5: Evaluate the effectiveness of the updated program

## INTEGRATE:
Step 1: Integrate the training program with existing systems and processesStep 2: Develop a plan for implementation and rolloutStep 3: Train trainers and other stakeholders on the programStep 4: Monitor and evaluate the implementation processStep 5: Make adjustments as needed
The DROIDs are launched to make small, yet significant changes to Project STARs in a stable manner. 

## DELIVER:
Step 1: Deliver the training program to the target audienceStep 2: Monitor and evaluate the delivery processStep 3: Provide ongoing support and resources to learnersStep 4: Collect feedback from learners and trainersStep 5: Use feedback to improve the training program
